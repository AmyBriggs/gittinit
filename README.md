# gittinit
View solutions from g32 classmate GitHub repos to get new ideas or become unstuck on assignments.  Gittinit allows a user to view and access public repos of all g32 team members.  It also allows the user to edit some of his/her GitHub profile information, and view the profile information of team members.  Technologies used include Node.js, Express.js, GitHub API and Oauth, Passport, PostgreSQL, Knex, Materialize, and Heroku for deployment.  We also used Meistertask to organize workflow and team member assignments.

A major challenge we encountered with the GitHub API was permissions: the Galvanize organization and associated teams are private, which limited our access to repos via the GitHub API.  Ultimately, we were limited to showing our team members' public repos.  As many of us have made our individual repos public, however, we still have access to a wide variety of files, and Gittinit makes referencing a teammate's code easy and quick.
